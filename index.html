$( document ).ready()
A page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery 
detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside 
$( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) 
is ready for JavaScript code to execute. Code included inside 
$( window ).load(function() { ... }) will run once the entire page (images or 
iframes), not just the DOM, is ready.

However, both objects contain the same DOM element. The .get() method is useful
 for testing if two jQuery objects have the same DOM element.

As a getter, the .css() method is valuable. However, it should generally be 
avoided as a setter in production-ready code, because it's generally best to 
keep presentational information out of JavaScript code. Instead, write CSS
 rules for classes that describe the various visual states, and then change 
 the class on the element.
 
 The event bubbling that occurs affords us the ability to add cells via Ajax 
 for example, without having to bind events directly to those cells since the
 parent table is listening for clicks and is therefore notified of clicks on 
 its children. If we weren't using delegation, we'd have to constantly bind 
 events for every cell that's added which is not only a performance issue, but
 could also become a maintenance nightmare.
