New Tab
----------
This project is meant to iteratively build a responsive webpage that replaces what I think ought to be the contents of a new tab.  I have an idea of what I want to put out there, but much of the project will be designed by feel rather than a concrete set of ideas.

There did not appear to be an officially supported means of pulling Chrome's synced data (locally would not have been a problem, but would not give the desired result) that I originally wanted to begin at. I exhaustively checked stackoverflow for an answer, a way worked a couple years ago and was silently removed. Ideally, this would supplant and allow me to extend the capabilities missing in Chrome, but not to be implemented as a plugin or otherwise rely on Chrome at all. I still want a way to salvage visited history remotely as I cannot find an alternate way of working with it.

I regularly upload a working version that is a few revisions behind this on my personal page: http://mgorgei.x10host.com
